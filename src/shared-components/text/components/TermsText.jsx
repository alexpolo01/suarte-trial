        <Text className="terms-text__text" paragraph justify medium>
                    Suarte grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use the

        <Text className="terms-text__subheading" medium>
                    2.3. Copyright
        </Text>

        <Text className="terms-text__text" paragraph justify medium>
                    Copyright gives artists who have created fixed, tangible works a bundle of rights in those works. 
                    The rights provide both artistic protection and ensure that artists can profit from what they’ve made. 
                    After an artist creates a piece, they have the right to make copies of their work, distribute those copies, 
                    perform or display the work publicly, or make works that derive from the original.
        </Text>

        <Text className="terms-text__text" paragraph justify medium>
                    Not all of those rights transfer to the collector who goes on to purchase the piece. While many collectors assume 
                    that a work’s copyright is transferred when they purchase a painting or a sculpture, that is not the case. 
                    Copyright only transfers to the piece’s new owner if its artist evidences that it is his or her intent to transfer it. 
                    What does this mean in practice? If you buy a painting from an artist, you then have the right to display your painting. 
                    But, unless you’ve received explicit permission from the artist, you do not have the legal right to take pictures of the 
                    piece, make postcards, and sell them.
