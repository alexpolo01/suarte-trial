                    outlined in this Policy or with your prior approval. Apart from the other instances of Personal Information sharing

        <Text className="privacy-policy-text__text margin" paragraph justify medium>
                    When you buy something from our marketplace or use certain Services, you'll need to provide payment details. 
                    This might be things like your credit card number, the type of card, and when it expires. We don't keep this 
                    credit card information ourselves. Instead, a third-party payment company stores it, and they have their own 
                    rules about how they use and keep this information. We do get some information from this payment company, 
                    including a unique code tied to you to approve your purchases and sometimes the last four numbers of your 
                    credit card. This is to help us stop any fraud or identity theft. If you don't want to give this payment 
                    information, there may be some Services on our platform you won't be able to use.
