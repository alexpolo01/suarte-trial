        question: "What makes Suarte different?",
        answer: "Its community, transparency, and unwavering commitment to providing value and innovation to its users. Suarte is what we've all been waiting for—a free-to-use app where collectors gather to discover, participate in, and acquire artworks from the best established and emerging galleries around the world.\n\nSuarte is daring to achieve something no one has done before: bring art closer to people with brand new features that create a deeper connection with the artworks and make it easier than ever to access the art market."

        question: "Is there a subscription system?",

        question: "What are Suarte's limited editions?",
        answer: `The purpose of limited editions is for the artist to be appreciated in various homes, places, cultures, and countries, in addition to boosting the income of artists and galleries. When uploading an artwork, simply check the "limited edition checkbox" and Suarte will take care of the rest.\n\nSuarte is in charge of the limited editions' manufacture and distribution. The company offers exceptional quality in each print as well as a one-of-a-kind buying experience, allowing them to match the original's breathtaking beauty.\n\nSuarte produces 250 limited editions in up to three different sizes smaller than the original. They are optional, and if requested, neither the gallery nor the artist need to be concerned about anything throughout the procedure. Galleries receive 30% of the final sale price and are responsible for agreeing terms with the artist.`
